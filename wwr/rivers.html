                    <h3>Is this a good trip for kids? What are the age ranges you allow?</h3>
                </button>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Absolutely this is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found however that children over
                        the
                        age of 8 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children
                        are
                        all over 8).
                        A common concern we get from parents is that their children will be bored stuck on a boat for
                        hours
                        at a time. Surprisingly we deal with very few bored children of any age. The areas we are
                        rafting
                        through are some of the most beautiful in the world,
                        and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep
                        things
                        very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven that river
                        guides
                        are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories...some of which are even true!

                        As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure
                        your
                        safety, our guides are all certified in Wilderness First aid and all start with at least 3 years
                        of
                        rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vest or personal flotation
                        device (PFD). Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give
                        you
                        an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare
                        for
                        and do in the event that you fall out of the raft.

                    <p>Are you kidding me! What's not great about whitewater rafting!...Let's describe a common day
                        on the
                        river.
                        Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful
                        starry
                        sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack
                        your
                        things and prepare for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water,
                        rapids,
                        calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or
                        5, after
                        setting up your cot you can relax with a good book or good company by the river, or explore
                        around
                        camp while your guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or
                        grilled
                        salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch oven brownies.
                        After dinner it's more relaxing, and you might even be able to talk your guide into another
                        story or
                        two to send you off to bed under more stars than you thought were possible.</p>

                    <p>If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year in advance. If you can
                        be more
                        flexible 6 months in advance is usually sufficient.</p>
