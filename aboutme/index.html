    <p>Hello guys :) I am from Taiwan. The weather in Taiwan is really humid which makes the weather hotter and colder. I currently live in the US because my husband is studying at BYU. We have been married for about 3 years. We don't have children now but we are hoping to have 2-3 kids.</p>
    <p2>I am majoring in Applied Technology. My first certificate is in Technology Support but I realize that I like coding more than computer stuff. So I changed it to this course. I am hoping to learn more about web and computer programing and push myself out of my comfort zone.</p2>
