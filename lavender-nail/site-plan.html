      <h2>About Manicures</h2>
      <p>
        If you haven’t done a manicure, you MUST read this article!
      </p>
      <p>
	      “A manicure is a mostly cosmetic beauty treatment for the fingernails and hands performed at home or in a nail salon. A manicure usually consists of filing and shaping the free edge of nails, pushing and clipping (with a cuticle pusher and cuticle nippers) any nonliving tissue (but limited to the cuticle and hangnails), treatments with various liquids, and the application of fingernail polish. When the same is applied to the toenails and feet, the treatment is referred to as a pedicure. 
        Together, the treatments may be known as a mani-pedi. Most nail polish can stay on nails for 2–3 days before another manicure is required for maintenance, if there is no damage done to it.”, from Wikipedia. However, most of our gel manicures can stay for 2 weeks or maybe longer if you treat them in the right way. Manicures are like dyed hair or curly hair that you got from a hair salon. They will stay for a period of time. In order to let them stay longer, you need to take care of them. So, let’s talk about how to make your gel manicure last?
      </p>
      <p>
        1.	Apply cuticle oil to your nail beds every day.
        2.	Do not file your nails unless absolutely necessary. If you need to, take care to file gently and always finish in a downward direction.
        3.	Always wear gloves when doing general household cleaning and gardening, hobbies that are rough on your hands or use harsh chemical products.
        4.	Avoid using your nails as tools to pull open or pick at anything.
        5.	Take care not to use any products that could contain solvent oils, which causes major damage to the color. These oils can be found in certain sun tan oils and insect repellent (Deet).
        6.	To avoid the color fading on holiday make sure you wash any chlorine off your hands after swimming and dry your nails before sunbathing.
        7.	If any lifting occurs make sure you don’t pick or pull at the nail. Call us so that we can assess the nail and decide if a repair is necessary.
        8.	Before your next treatment be sure to book in a gel removal to ensure no damage occurs on the natural nail.

      <h2>FAQ</h2>
      <h3>Why is the time that manicure stay on my nails different when I go to different store?</h3>
      <p>
        Every manicurist has different material. Some of them may be more firm but hard to remove. Some of them may be easy to remove but not firm as the first one. However, there are still some of customers’ manicure last less than average at our studio but they went to other studio and the manicure can last longer than average and vice versa. So, it really depends on what manicurists and material match your nails. Hope you can find the one that you love. Of course, we hope that one will be us.
      </p>
      <h3>Why is my manicure always lifting from the back?</h3>
      <p>
        There are a lot of reason for that. The most common one is that you often overuse your fingertips. Another one is that if you are not used to do things with your finger pulp and you have long nails, this will increase the chance you put too much pressure on your fingertips.
